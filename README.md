## About Team Empower

Community Districts are the smallest level of government in NYC and act as a bridge between local communities and the broader city-wide efforts. This project aims to work with the leaders of those communities to empower their districts using data science. Our team will be working with Celestina Leon (District Manager, Brooklyn Community Board 4) and Shawn Campbell (District Manager, Brooklyn Community Board 14) to uplift their respective districts. Some of our solutions include an interactive tool for land use applications, an interactive dashboard for local budgeting and a mapping tool to determine community needs.
